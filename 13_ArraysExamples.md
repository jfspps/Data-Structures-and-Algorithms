# Examples of algorithms on arrays #

The links below go straight to the code examples. They all use the following structure:

```cpp
struct Array
{
    int size;
    int A[size];    //represents the number of elements with user-defined values
    int length; //represents the number of elements which are not padded with zeros
}
```
